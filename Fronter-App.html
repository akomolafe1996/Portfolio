            <p>PROCESS:</p>
            <p>We started by creating a user flow map from logging in to our desired end goal. Our two main ideas to start with were creating a forum (which we called "BUZZ") where students could intereact with each other, with staff, and with former pupils; and creating a social-media-type profile page, which doubles as a portfolio page, where students can view each other's work and leave likes and comments as a form of peer review. With these ideas in mind, we decided to interview stakeholders to hear their opinions and see which they found more appealing.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="questions">
                    <p>We wanted to know what students felt were the main issues with Fronter and if they felt our solution was a good way to solve the problem</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>We then set about designing the prototype for the app. My role in the Design Sprint was that of the "Stitcher", so I took everyone's artboards and linked them in a way that meant there was at least one viable user flow within which users can perform different tasks </p>
            <p><span>Then came the testing...</span></p>
            <div class="secondpart">
                <p>In testing, we utilised two methods, the 5 second test and the trunk test, which we had been introduced to in the previous module. <span>These tests proved hugely benefitial to me, far more so than the interviews which, in all honesty, I had not found extremely helpful. The tests, though, brought up useful insights by potential users. For example, there was confusion surrounding navigation, as a result of there not being a properly functioning burger menu. Also, the general consensus was that the profile section was a useful solution, but people were less than keen on the forum. This is why I chose to focus on the profile part of the app in when it came time to code</span></p>

        <div class="keyinsights">
            <p>THE WEBSITE:</p>
            <p>Since my introduction to it at the start of the course, coding was something I'd found very difficult. Even now, although I am far more confident, I wouldn't say I'm where I would like to be. Therefore, going into the coding part of the task, things definitely seemed daunting. And at first, I was having a rough time of it. In fact, it wasn't until the last 2 days of coding that I really hit a breakthrough. My issue had always been with CSS Grid Layout; making sure the presentation was exactly as I had envisioned using XD and drawing wireframes (which we had learned to do in the very first module) etc.</p>
            <p><span>Coincidentally, seeing as the focus of our app was student collaboration, it was actually another student that got me to understand how to properly implement the knowledge which I already had. I learned to use multiple divs, and to use fractions and percentages instead of pixels in CSS. I also learnt how to properly use the Developer Tools in Chrome. And so I ended up with a finished website that actually looked somewhat identical to my prototype - something I had not been able to do in just the previous Module. In fact, I was so happy to have learned this that I went back and improved on the "Cycling In Copenhagen" website which I'd been so dissapointed in. </span></p>

            <p>PERSONAL OBSERVATIONS:</p>
            <p>This project was a turning point for me in terms of coding. While I already had knowledge of HTML and CSS as necessary technologies used in producing digital content, my ability to properly utilise said technologies was certainly not where it should be. Through repition and collaboration with a classmate, I became confident in my ability to use these technologies in the designing and development of digital user interfaces
