            <p>Unfortunately, I was not here while the interactive animation production project was taking place (I had to return to England for a short period of time), and so I cannot add it to my portfolio. I have, however, demonstrated the ability to carry out several, if not all, of the tasks and objectives set out in the project. <br><br> I did a storyboard as part of the Basic Content module. Within this Basic Animation module, I also created an interactive animation using javascript where buttons are clicked and subsequent animations occur (the link to which can be found above) <br><br>I demonstrated an ability to work well with my fellow students in other tasks, such as both Design Sprints, and I completed a team canvas on both occasions.I also displayed the ability to create content for a particular target group in both those tasks. <br><br>There have also been several times in this semester when I have made use of Mood Boards and style tiles, most recently, and to the best effect, in my opinion, with the creation Tech Lounge App  (which is includen on this site).</p>
