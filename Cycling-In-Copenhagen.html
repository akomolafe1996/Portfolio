            <p>PROCESS:</p>
            <p>We chose to focus on tourists as our target audience because, with copenhagen being so widely known as a bike-friendly city, we felt tourists would already be aware how crucial bikes are as a form of transport. As such, it would be benefitial to show tourists 3 things - 1) The rules for cycling in copenhagen; 2) How to rent bikes in copenhagen; 3) places to go on your bike in copenhagen. With the website, we always intended for it to be something of an sign-post with minimal information, but which could point people in the right direction to where to find the information they are after. With the video, we wanted to portray a protagonist and an antagonist; one of whom follows the rules and so goes home smiling, while the other goes home upset after having received a ticket.</p>

            <div class="secondpart">
                <p>While we had originally been a group of 4, one of us had gone back to their home country for a period of time and another had switched groups, so we were left with just two members of our group. We soon realised we might have to abandon some of the narrative elements of the video because it would be difficult to do with just the two of us. Coupled with the fact that there was also the website to focus on, we essentially split tasks 50/50, and my job was to focus on the website (doing the prototype and coding). I wasn't particularly enthused with this, given that I struggled quite a bit with coding, but I agreed nonetheless. Needless to say, the website did not turn out as I would have wanted.</p>

            <p>THE MICROSITE:</p>
            <p>In designing the prototype for the microsite, I used the KÃ¸benhavns Kommune design guide. This includes the use of icons, colours and content from a brochure. This was a useful learning experience for me as up until this point there had not been an "creative restraints", so to speak, placed on me. Although there wasn't a client I could speak to or interview, it was my first taste of user-centered design.</p>
            <p><span>I had sent links of the prototype to people to test, asking about the general design and usability. Feedback was largely positive, but when it came time to code I definitely struggled. I ended up with a messy website that in no way resembled the prototype I had worked on. It was frustrating, but there was not a lot I could do about it at the time. I simply wasn't able to execute the design in HTML and CSS. As I mention in the "Fronter App" section of this website, though, it wasn't until later on in the course that I learned to properly code so I can now create a site based on a web prototype or wieframes. As such I went back to recreate the microsite, as can be seen in the images below and the links above. </span></p>
            <p>For the microsite, design-wise, implemented what we had learned in Colour Theory in the first module and chose to go for orange and blue. The orange was because it is a warm, friendly, inviting colour and our target audience was tourists, and the blue because it conveys seriousness and stability, which is what the Kommune would want.</p>

            <p>PERSONAL OBSERVATIONS:</p>
            <p>Coming back to re-do the website part of this project was particularly pleasing to me because it represented the progress I have made over such a short period of time. I wasn't so much interested in making design changes to the prototype or the website, more so showing that I can now create a website that resembles the one that I designed in the prototype a month or so earlier.
