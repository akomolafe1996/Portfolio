            <p>PROCESS:</p>
            <p>The first step we took as a group was to decide what problem to tackle. There were many suggestions and after a short period of deliberation, we settled on making improvements to how the Tech Lounge functions. Having done this, we decided to interview stakeholders to see what issues they had with the Tech Lounge, how they would tackle said issues, and their thoughts on our solution. I volunteered to interview the Tech Lounge workers as I had been unhappy with how I’d conducted my interview in the previous Design Spring – the quality of questions, depth of insight etc. </p>

                <div class="questions">
                    <p>I set up a Google Form (above are some of the questions included), and filled out the responses as I went along…(this is an example of using field research, which we learned about in the first Module)</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>With the interviews done, we set about sketching designs for the app, each of us individually designing pages before deciding as a group which sketches we like best. </p>
            <p><span>But we'd forgotten something very important...</span></p>
            <div class="secondpart">
                <p>We hadn't created a Mood board or Style tile, and so prototyping was not going very well at all --- design-wise, all of our artboards looked completely different. So we stopped and decided to create a Mood board and Style tile, keeping the reccommendations from our interviewees in mind - something that I think was instrumental in how well the project turned out. <span>Honestly, although we had been introduced to practice-oriented design approaches from the very first module, it had never really been something I put much stock in. It had merely been a tedious part of the design process. This project taught me how crucial this method is in ensuring user needs are met.</span></p>

            <p>KEY INSIGHTS:</p>
            <p>A large part of the success of this project came down to the interviews we conducted. With the previous design sprint, I feel like I did not fully appreciate the importance of the interview process. While I understood that it could help us ascertain the needs of the user, to me it was no more than a formality. That is why I feel like the end-product of that project, while acceptable, lacked focus and was somewhat generic.</p>
            <p><span>The interviews we carried out with this project, particularly the interview of workers in the Tech Lounge, gave us a clear idea of what both the user and the “client” were after – right down to design aspects like colour and a general aesthetic, as well as more functional aspects like the ability to actually see how to use the devices that can be rented in the tech lounge. With this, we were able to create and adhere to a detailed and clear Mood board and Style tile – which went a long way in making sure we ended up with a final prototype for an app that was coherent and thoroughly solved our specified problem. </span></p>

            <p>PERSONAL OBSERVATIONS:</p>
            <p>Without a doubt, this is one of the projects I’m most proud to have worked on this semester. In the initial stages of planning, while filling out the group canvas, I made it clear that my goal for this project was to have an end-product that I was satisfied with – and I definitely feel like I achieved that.</p>
